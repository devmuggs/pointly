## Inspiration

I wanted to create a service that I could use with my girlfriend as a means of "doing a favour" and earning points which could be redeemed for rewards. The idea is to gamify everyday tasks and interactions, making it fun and engaging.
Target users include couples, friend groups, families, teachers and students, and anyone looking to gamify their interactions.

The primary objective allowing to digitise and gamify traditionally token-based systems.

i.e. a child doing chores for points, a couple doing favours for each other, a manager rewarding employees for good work, etc.
